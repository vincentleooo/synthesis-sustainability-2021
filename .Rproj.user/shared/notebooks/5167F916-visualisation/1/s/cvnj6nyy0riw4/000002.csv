I had been wrong the whole time!\n\nOnly 3 numbers to win.

Too complicated...not as fun)\n\nDuring one difficult business period....for the sweep ticket I bought, I won the last 4 numbers with a prize money of $6.00. I continued to buy with the prize number....I kept winning $6.00 for one year!\n\nIt was comforting cause it felt like a sign to ask me to hang in there...\n\nToday it reminded me of that comfort with this 2nd winning ticket.\n\nAnd this time, my heart is full and light and grateful.\n\nActually it is quite fun to join the queue and listen to the conversation between the  customers and the toto ticket seller.

These days, a lot of choices and still new ones to come. \n2.Yesterday I bought this new bread and it is nice and cheap @ $1.50.\n3. I saw chinese words. Quan Mai Mian Bao .Now they include chinese words. \n4. This is produced in Malaysia for Singapore supermarket, NTUC\n\nButter\n1. Used to be boring, not much choices. \nI only bought SCS.\nThese days, a lot of choices and still new ones to come.\n2. The price has increased from below $4 to $7 for a block of 250 butter.\n3. Now we have weight of 250g, 220g and 200g.\n4. Now we have butter from Australian, New Zealand, France...\n5. I can now buy French butter for the same price or even cheaper than SCS. It has been a while since I ate SCS butter.\n\nAvocado\n1. Used to be boring, not much choices. Only Australian avocado @anonymised_user $2.50 each\nThese days we have avocado from Australia, New Zealand, mexico....and their quality has improved to be comparable to Australian Avocado.\n2. Now I pay between $1 to $1.50 for an avocado.\n\nAnd then, there are fresh milk, kiwi fruits, cheese, broccoli, orange, apple, strawberries..... All kinds of fruits and vegetables.\n\nI guess... This is the benefit of capitalism, globalization.\n\nBut.... How can business survives long term if the competition is so fierce and price is one important factor for consumer to choose cause the difference between products have narrowed? \n\nAnd I heard my kids said to me the other day about sustainability.\n\n Sustainability.""

Emma's quest to find an alternative to wool and synthetics materials takes her to Emerald, Queensland where she visits an Australian cotton farm and meets a farmer who dispels the myths about the cotton industry.\n\nWhen asked about the making of the film, Emma explained, \""The purpose of the film was very clear from the beginning: explain the main issues tied to the wool industry, and show that there is a better way forward. We wanted to highlight plant-based fiber alternatives and show that you can still support local farmers and industry, without being cruel to animals or supporting an industry contributing significantly to the climate crisis.\""\n\nThe film is set to premiere next Thursday, 22nd July 2021 with a virtual screening on www.collectivefashionjustice.org/willow-and-claude.

It reminded me the value of preserving your fresh produce and the value of having such healthy options in the kitchen. \n\nIt reminds me of having a minimal waste kitchen. It is not quite zero waste yet but at least the plastic is recycled (we hope), the used water is collected for watering the plants, and the food scraps are composted in soil. \n\n#kitchenadventures #thankful""                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     "

I was most interested in the family story. \n\nThis is a garden and learning space rented by a family business. A sibling does 3D sculptures. There are photos of his work and I easily recognised at least 2 of them. Another sibling pointed out her hand-drawn illustration of flowering plants. \n\nThe ladies, whom I was introduced to today, were really friendly. They are happy to make friends, chat and exchange knowledge.

Helping others outside our own 'hood to kick-start Compost Hubs seemed like a far-away dream. \n\nToday, I had the opportunity to be part of a 10-min FB live chat with Jeremy of Jurong Lake Gardens, LY (allotment gardener and compost maker), and host Kris @anonymised_user\n\nThe live chat comes after several months of journeying with a small group of Jurong Lake Gardens volunteers and allotment gardeners, and guiding them to become confident compost makers and foodscrappers. We started off as trainers. We experimented new ideas with them. Over time, we become friends who simply enjoy each other's presence. It is heartwarming to hear how some were inspired to kick-start similar community compost initiatives in their own residential estates.  \n\nGroundwork discussions with Jurong Lake Gardens to encourage community-based composting at the national garden started back in 2019. This was before Project Black Gold became a project where we could collaborate and reach for our individual and shared goals. \n\n#community #compost #JurongLakeGardens #thankful #sgcompoststory""                                                                                                                                                 "

He was game enough to bring some BYO food containers there and back.

They advised us to store the bread in the freezer after slicing.\n\nHanzhong's mum also shared with me some slices of homemade cake. She said it ended up more bread-like than cake.

"1"," ""Second time at making rings that we would treasure. Thankful for the guidance of Lyn from @anonymised_user\n\nThis second making experience is less scary. I find myself at ease with using the vernier caliper (last used in school) and various tools. There are moments where @anonymised_user and I had to work together as a team  \n\nBoth ring making sessions are special. The first session was scary (deal with the dust, new machines, loud sound, fear of being cut by moving metal and all). It represented us taking a huge step forward as a couple and making a silent commitment to walk our life journey together. The second session represented us completing this step and ready to take the next step forward.\n\nThe choice of wood rings was intentional. We originally looked for options to make our own metal rings. It was difficult to know the source of metal which was a concern. Wood rings became our choice as wood at Studio MUYU are rescued from locally cut trees. It is as environmentally sustainable an option as you can get for rings. That wood may not last as long as metal is not of key concern as one can always make a new pair of rings. While we do intend to treasure the rings, it is the symbolism and the relationship that we treasure rather than the physical ring itself. \n\nThe entire process supports us in working together as a couple and creating meaningful moments that we will remember. \n\n#couplerings #whatwevalue"""
