2472,"Urgent action is needed to tackle Hong Kong waste problem. Although the Tourism and Hospitality industry significantly impacts the amount of waste generated in Hong Kong, there are no recent statistics or research conducted around the industry's contribution to this problem.

In response to this research gap, GREEN Hospitality, in collaboration with Eat Without Waste, kick-started ""Waste Deep"", an exploratory study about food and single-use food packaging waste in the hospitality industry in early 2021. This study aims to bridge knowledge gaps, build awareness, mobilize industry stakeholders, and encourage future research. 

The @anonymised_user (HKU Business School) at @anonymised_user has contributed to this report through the involvement of student interns, researchers and instructors of its Social Venture Management (SVM) Course.

If you want to learn more alarming facts about food and packaging waste in Hong Kong, join us on 14th July 1pm on Zoom, for an Industry Brief followed by a panel discussion with Erwin Sikkenga from @anonymised_user Hotel & Towers and Ashley Bang from Eat Without Waste @anonymised_user moderated by Camille Fabre from @anonymised_user where we will discuss the research findings from two aspects - food waste and single-use food packaging waste.

2476,"The pandemic is an unprecedented situation that has affected all aspects of the hospitality and tourism industry, making it one of the hardest hit. 

Unlike some, Hilton and its brands in South East Asia saw the ongoing pandemic as an opportunity to advance the sustainability agenda through collective efforts in plastic reduction, food waste management, and conservation initiatives.

Fully acknowledging that the region it operates in is largely dependent on tourism, Hilton's Vice President of Operations in South East Asia, Paul Hutton, perceives it as the company's responsibility to create positive change.

Accompanied by the wisdom of 10 mentors they worked on solutions that can tackle #wastecrisis in the Hong Kong's hospitality industry. The teams pitched their ideas to 65 attendees during the Innovation Night and over 300 watching the livestream. All projects were extremely interesting and kudos to all the teams who came up with these pilots in less than 2 weeks time! 

Our 5 judges picked the 3 winning teams which each tackled a different challenge: GroundsDown (Food Waste), Terre (Waste Reduction & Circularity), and GrinBean (Waste Segregation).

Once again - thanks for the support from our venue sponsors, catering sponsors, and gift & goodies sponsors, our Hackathon & Innovation Night was held successfully.

Team GrinBean, consisting of the four members, Tom Leung, Ivy Lee, Archie Loong, James Lam proposed a solution that would optimize the recycling management system and alleviate the issue of recycling and recovery of recyclables.
 
Their idea is to develop a recycling bin that will automatically sort recyclables, with sensors to record the waste and a management portal to record this data.

Team GroundsDown, consisting of the four members, Dorothy Erin Gan, Elle Rex, Gabriel Chan, and Jenny You, came up with the idea which they call an ""online dating system for trash"".

The solution is conceived to offer Hong Kong's hotel and hospitality industry an easier way to manage its waste. In essence, the platform will connect hotels and F&B outlets with resource recovery centres around Hong Kong. By entering the date, time, and location of waste collection, hotels and F&B outlets can then search for the price, service details, ratings, and customer reviews of different service providers, and can reach out to their preferred service providers accordingly.

2554,"As the first hotel in Southeast Asia to introduce #plantbased alternatives such as Beyond Burger, Beyond Sausage, Just Egg and Omnipork to its menus, Grand Hyatt Singapore @anonymised_user has since 2010 been implementing sustainability initiatives to promote economic and environmental sustainability.

To minimize food waste, the hotel works with local startup Treatsure to let diners take out buffet items in the last hour of operating mealtime for $10 box each. 
A portion of the surplus food is donated to #socialenterprise food truck Kerbside Gourmet to be distributed to underprivileged communities twice a week. Meanwhile, the hotel also partners with Biomax Technologie to convert 1,000kg of daily food waste from the hotel's five restaurants, 16 event venues and 677 rooms to 300kg of organic pathogen-free fertilizers, which turns waste into treasure while saving the hotel 55,000 trash bags every year.

In addition to replacing #plasticstraws with paper alternatives last year, Grand Hyatt Singapore now uses aprons made from recycled plastic bottles (each apron is made with seven bottles and saves 86% water, 70% energy, and 75% CO2 emissions) and 100% compostable trash bags made from plant starch. 
Through its installation of a gas-powered Trigeneration Plant to provide 30% of its electricity needs, the hotel has been able to reduce its carbon footprint by 1,200 tonnes per year, equivalent to removing 300 cars off the roads.

What are the latest innovative sustainability initiatives at your hospitality business? What are the challenges and takeaways?

1. Clean properly, and if you wish, dry them in the sun.
2. Extract the essence by boiling them for a while, then straining with a sieve. 
What about the rest? 
1. Dry the clean scraps under the sun for about 2 days, then panfry on low heat.
2. Grind scraps with food a processor or grinder.
Voila! You get natural veggie powder for soup!

8454,"RAWR!!! Have you been reusing your glass bottles?  Gutsy Foods has. You might have wondered why our glass bottles look different every time you get your kombucha, water kefir or Jun tea from us. This is because we want to be more conscious in our packaging.
...
According to @anonymised_user Singapore's glass waste recycling rate is at only 20%. While glass is inert and doesn't cause direct harm to the environment, it takes up permanent landfill space as it does not break down. This means that every glass bottle that's created will remain on Earth forever unless it successfully makes its way to a glass recycling plant. 
And this is why #GutsyFoodsSG embraces a zero waste policy in packaging its #GutsyWK, #GutsyBooch and #GutsyJun. The precious pennies saved from not having to buy new bottles is transferred to you, the consumer. Each time you return your bottle to us, you get a cash rebate of $0.20 on your next purchase! (Btw if you didn't know, beer companies collect their bottles from coffee shops, restaurants and hotels and reuse them too.) By supporting Gutsy Foods, you are not only getting to drink our amazing homebrewed and artisanally-blended cultured beverages at a reasonable price, but also becoming part of the zero waste movement.

If you'd like us to use your used bottles, we would be more than happy to. Don't worry; all bottles are thoroughly washed and sterilised before reusing. Most importantly, if you're already an existing customer of Gutsy's, please remember to U.B.R.B - that's Use Bottle, Return Bottle. Okurrr? And for those of you who have contributed your unwanted bottles - we thank you with much love and gratitude from our hearts.

.
.
As a former gluten free baker, I got very excited when I spotted an extensive range of gluten-free refills at @anonymised_user last weekend - pasta, lasagne sheets, plain & self raising flour and cornmeal. They have everything you can imagine - including the less healthy fun foods like shreddies, chocolate covered things and jelly beans. They have really capitalised on the 'pick'n'mix' appeal, which is great but *so* easy to get carried away!
.
.
This is the first attempt at baking a vegan AND gluten free polenta cake! Luckily I don't have to avoid gluten for medical reasons but still enjoy baking without. This must be the tastiest version that I've baked to date. No faffing around with butter or eggs, using oil and soya milk with cider vinegar is so much easier. .
.
We often have left over sherbet from my daughters packet of dip dab, so I decided to sprinkle it over like fizzy snow [?] .

Seasonal flavours of kombucha was available on tap, with a discount if you brought back your empty bottle to refill.

13216,"Did you know that the average Singaporean household throws away 5kg of food waste every week? That amounts to more than 26,000 tonnes of unconsumed food that is worth $342 million being discarded every year! 


Temasek's Ecosperity platform is running #ARecipeForChange, a month long campaign in March which focuses on how our food choices impact the environment. This food sustainability campaign uses a simple ABC acronym to encourage individuals to take small but significant steps in:
Avoiding Food Waste, Buying Local Produce and Choosing Alternative Proteins.


In line with this campaign, Kitchen Collective, an initiative by a group of future leaders from @anonymised_user is launching their website which features quick recipe fixes using leftover ingredients to reduce food waste!
Check out the video below to learn how you can take concrete steps to contribute in saving our Earth by re-thinking about the unconsumed food we have in our kitchens!

Well look no further! We are working with a group of Future Leaders from @anonymised_user on an initiative to reduce food waste from our kitchens! While Singapore has taken a stride towards reducing food waste, we believe that there are still opportunities for us to play our part from the ground up.

14529,"September has been amazing. I prepped and delivered workshops and talks for local schools looking to be zero waste, champion climate action, explore composting, care for nature and more... This would not have been possible without consistent steps - taken over years - to follow my curiosity and learn alongside communities. There is much satisfaction in being able to distil insights from individual and collective practice, to meet demand for authentically-delivered paid services.

Earlier this week, @anonymised_user and I conducted a 1.5 hour workshop. While the workshop focused on composting, the school was intrigued by the idea of a food waste audit and asked that we integrate it in.

A stumbling block I faced - while I advocate for such audits, I have not participated in one myself. It was a personal triumph when I realised that what I knew was enough. Within a day, I created teacher's guide, student's worksheet and slides - all of which I knew would meet the school's needs.

This is a quote that I shared with the school. This being the pandemic period, the workshop was online and 100 people called in from their homes. They included the school's vice principal, interested teachers, student leaders and student climate action champs.

16265,"Last week the U.K. Government reported there has been a 90% decline in the use of single use plastic bags since the 5p charge was introduced in 2015. (This is great, but it still fails to include the 28% increase of ""bags for life"" which are made of more durable plastic.) I love seeing more supermarkets ditch the unnecessary single use plastic that covers our fresh produce. A staggering 150 million tonnes ends up in landfill each year, with 8 million tonnes entering our world's oceans taking up to 1000 years to decompose...

19380,"I did a corporate Fridge Restock with 5 educators from Crest Secondary School today for @anonymised_user

They collected 7 heavy cartons of veggies from Desker Road and ferried them to Dorset community fridges.

Fridge Restock as a corporate mission gives participants the challenge of running an actual food rescue, less the asking from businesses.

Every food rescue has 3 components to it:

1. Food Donor
2. Transport
3. Food Recipient

#1 and #3 are relatively easy to find. Where food rescues often fail is the execution of transporting the food from the Food Donor to the Food Recipient.

This first-hand experience is what this mission is designed to give participants. It makes participants think outside the box, makes them use their resourcefulness to find solutions from what is around them.

In today's case, the participants made use of the many shopping trolleys lying around to transport the veggies to the community fridges. Bravo!

If you'd like to organise a similar experience for your staff or students, please email us sgfoodrescue@anonymised_user

19388,"I was sitting next to these baskets of green capsicums today when a Food Rescuer asked me, ""Daniel, do you taste any difference between the green, yellow, and red capsicums?"" I looked up at him and said, ""Of course! The green ones are bitter, and the yellow and red ones are sweet. It's just like a bitter gourd which is bitter when green, but sweet when yellow."" ""Wait wait wait, you mean the green, yellow, and red are all the same vegetable?"" he asked. 
Yup. 
This was something I didn't know until I started doing veggie rescues and coming across loads of capsicums being thrown away. 
I started to see capsicums in differing shades, with some green turning yellow or red. Or some with all 3 colours. Then I started asking questions and found out the truth. 
They are all the same fruit (not vegetable). The green ones are favoured by Indians who cook them in curries and stir fries. Chinese prefer the yellow or red. They are most often used not as a main dish, but nowadays I eat them as fruits or make edible cups out of them. 
I also learned that green capsicums are cheapest and red capsicums are most expensive. This is because the red ones take longest to ripen. In business, time is money. It means the farms can't harvest them as quickly, that's why they cost more. 
Food Rescue is not just about free food and doing good. You also learn new things about our food every time you come for one of our missions.

19393,"#Repost @anonymised_user with @anonymised_user

I am a strange person with a strange hobby. I fill fridges with vegetables for fun. 
Went with @anonymised_user to fill the Tampines community fridges today. Why so much unsellable veggies today? Because it rained heavily yesterday afternoon. 
When it rains heavily, vegetable sellers whose shops are not linked to sheltered walkways go unpatronised. No customers come, and the veggies sit in the shops unsold. Then they get discarded the next day. 
Or they would have if not for these community fridges. 
Anyone can play a part in reducing food waste. Talk to your usual vegetable seller at the wet market. Ask them if they regularly have unsold veggies at the end of the day, and can they give it to you instead of throwing them away? You can give it those who don't have enough to eat, or to the elderly in your neighbourhood. - Daniel

19395,"Delivering 150kg of rescued cabbages to Helga, a member of the freegan community. 
She spent 3-4 hours peeling off the outer leaves of the cabbages. They originally came looking spoiled, and smelling spoiled. But we should never judge a vegetable (or a person) by how they look. 
As freegans, we know that appearances can be deceiving. All the cabbages needed was some who believed that there was beauty on the inside. 
As a community, freegans in Singapore provided their consumption services to @anonymised_user to consume a large portion of the 2 tons of rescued cabbages. 
Giving away these cabbages to our neighbours served as a golden opportunity to educate them on food waste, how to reduce it, and how not to judge vegetables. 
After spending the whole day rescuing cabbages, I took 5 ugly cabbages with me to a food waste session in NUS Residential College 4. 
I demonstrated to the students how an ugly cabbage, after peeling off the outer rotting leaves, revealed a pristine (and huge) cabbage underneath. 
I think it's amazing that young people today are learning about food waste in school. 
I heard one freegan's neighbour remark that we are like beggars, taking and using things that other people don't want, only to be scolded by his own daughter who said that she learned in school that what we are doing is helping to reduce food waste.

19397,"I went with @anonymised_user on their 4th Veggie Rescue Mission yesterday. On Saturdays, we have to collect less than usual, because we have limited delivery time. Hence, we collect enough for only one Food Recipient. We try very very very hard not to collect too much, because if not, we will have to deal with the stress of finding Food Recipients. 
We did a shout-out a few days ago, asking for charity organisations that can receive and consume large amounts of vegetables and fruits, so we're hoping to connect with persons in some of these organisations soon. There is a horrendous amount of perfectly edible (but not aesthetically perfect) food being thrown away every day. Sometimes we feel a bit helpless because we feel that for all our hard work, we're only rescuing 0.0002% of the amount of food that gets wasted in Singapore every year.

19399,"In the past (which is like 8 months ago), we used to dumpster dive in Little India for veggies. Then some people said, ""What if we approached shopkeepers and asked them to give us the vegetables they no longer want and are going to throw away?"" So we did. Now we collect veggies 2-3 times a week from some shopkeepers, such as @anonymised_user . We want to ask more shopkeepers to give us their unsellable but edible veggies, but already at our current situation, supply outstrips demand. 
We need more people to consume the food. The regulars at this activity have stopped coming because their fridges are too full. Come one time, and your fridge will be packed for weeks.

The Saturday run is different from the Thursday run because we have a tighter schedule to keep to, and can have only one Food Recipient. 
Also present that morning was @anonymised_user with their Fresh Food Truck activity. Back in Nov, we attended one such activity and learned how to do it for ourselves. Thank you @anonymised_user for showing us how. 
More than half of the vendors told us that they had already given their surplus stock to Food Bank, so we said, ""Great! "" Because we are all allies in the fight to reduce food waste. Even so, we managed to fill more than half our truck. 
The point is, there is so much food waste that takes place that there's so much more room for more to be done. If you're interested to lend a hand, check out @anonymised_user on Insta and FB.

We were pleasantly surprised to find out that there were some still inside, so we loaded it to the brim with more. 
As we were there, a resident in a neighbouring block came to talk to us. She said that she never gets a chance to take anything from the fridge because every time she's there, the fridge is empty. So we said to her, ""Auntie, you go and open now."" She opened the door and got a shock when she saw so many cucumbers. ""This one cannot eat so much, otherwise leg pain,"" she said as she took out a reusable bag and filled it with seven of them. 
We spent some time talking to the other residents about the fridges, which they said was Mr @anonymised_user who put the fridge there. They also told us that sometimes some charities will put trays of eggs inside, and instead of trays, they should put individual eggs so that everyone can have some, instead of only a few residents who have a lot. 
Well, now everyone can have some cucumbers. Enjoy!

While this system already uses 20-25 times less water, fertilizer and land compared to conventional farms, we want to push the boundaries further.

 As part of my internship wirh @anonymised_user I did a virtual placement with @anonymised_user 

 I was introduced to this amazing new type of plastic that is completely natural and can dissolve in the hot water.

 I asked if it would affect the taste, and so I ran an experiment with coffee experts who can feel different notes and flavours in the coffee.

 Check the video to find out if they managed to find the cup with the bioplastic.

 Do you think this could be one of the solutions to avoid single use plastic?

 It is made of seaweed 
 It feels like plastic but it is 100% natural
 It is vegan and 100% cruelty-free
 It doesn't contain any synthetic or other harmful chemicals
 It is biodegradable and disappears in the soil within a week
It dissolves in the hot water within 30 seconds
AND it doesn't affect the taste!

34630," Did you know?  Fruits and vegetables have the highest waste rates of any food.

According to the United Nations Environment Program, per capita waste is between 95-115 kg in Europe and North America, and only 6-11kg a year in sub-Saharan Africa, South and Southeastern Asia.

To minimize food waste, plan ahead so that you don't over-buy and check the use-by dates of fresh food before purchasing. Preserve when possible, eat the leftovers or compost! 

You can follow these simple tips to extend the life of your fresh produce: 

1. If you're able to, buy from a specialty grocery or farmers market - you can be more certain of buying produce that was picked in its prime and delivered to the market directly. 

2. Remove vegetable tops - beets, carrots, radishes and turnips may have leafy, green tops attached that should be removed and stored separately as they pull moisture from the roots and cause the vegetable to become dry and shriveled.

3. Remove excess moisture - make sure to pat produce dry before storing. You can also wrap it in a lint-free kitchen towel or line the storage bag with a paper towel to absorb any remaining moisture.

4. Think about the placement in the fridge - placing fresh produce at the back where it is too cold and sometimes icy may cause it to deteriorate more quickly. 

5. Store items that you will leave out of the refrigerator, like tomatoes, potatoes, onions, garlic and fruits in a cool, dry place. PRO TIP: Don't keep potatoes and onions next to each other!

6. Roots, greens, lettuces and herbs can be revived by placing it in iced water. 

7. Check your produce during storage - change the bag or towel if too much moisture has accumulated. Remove any wilted parts or moldy spots and refrigerate again.

.
I was jonesing for some and came across this certified organic, plant-based double chocolate cookies from @anonymised_user at an Esso petrol station.

Made in New Zealand, with gluten-free flour, 57% Belgian coca solids (I love dark chocolate), organic quinoa and coconut oil, it's actually pretty good for $6.50 (about the same price as my usual choice of @anonymised_user cookies)! Swipe left to see the full list of ingredients.

The cookies are a little harder than the average cookie (I guess because there's no butter or eggs), but makes it perfect for dipping it in milk  The bag is resealable and also recyclable in store, but since I'm eating it in Singapore, please note this is a [?] grade 7 plastic, so put it in the trash or upcycle it, so it doesn't contaminate other recyclable grades.

Happy Monday! [?]

Did you know that organic material doesn't break down well in a landfill?  
An estimated 1/3 of the world's food  produced for consumption never reaches the consumer's table. And in the US, a lot of that food waste happens at the levels of distribution and individual consumption. And all that wasted food cause lots more harm while sitting in a dump.  
We need to be changing the processes of global food production that lead to so much waste. But right now in quarantine, you can start composting to cut down on your personal waste AND keep food waste out of landfills.  
 
Shout out to @anonymised_user who helps us compost when we don't have a backyard.  
 
Check out @anonymised_user and @anonymised_user for more info on food waste, and @anonymised_user for tips if you wanna go the DIY compost route.

37847,"Thank you Cold Storage Supermarkets and Jason's Marketplace Singapore for making Confetti - Snack of the Month! 

Grateful for acknowledging our efforts as an impact driven snack company to upcycle food surplus and craft imperfect produce to award-winning gourmet snacks in our fight to support global hunger relief efforts.

 Facts about food waste remain shocking - 

1) Over 1/3 of all food produced globally goes to waste.

2) Annual value of food wasted globally is $1 trillion, and weighs 1.3 billion tonnes.

3) All the world's nearly one billion hungry people could be fed on less than 1/4 of food that is wasted in the US, UK and Europe.

4) An area larger than China is used to grow food that is never eaten.

5) If food waste were a country it would be the 3rd largest emitter of greenhouse gases.

6) Reducing food waste is the #1 solution to the climate crisis, according to Project DrawDown - Above electric cars, solar power and plant-based diets.

Thank you to our partners like Upcycled Food Association in our fight against food loss and repurposing rescued veggies and fruit into tasty and nutrient dense CPG snacks to delight global consumers. [?]

39448,"Pretty Ugly Lunch at the recent GUI Farmers' Market. What a wonderful concept of ""waste"" to table, with perfectly fine vegetables rescued from pasir panjang market and other contributions, transformed into gorgeous and tasty dishes. Haven't been fan of fine dining but this lunch is just so accessible yet exquisite.
Amazed by how the chefs adapted the menu the day before. Because ya nv know what ya gonna get from a food rescue. (Maybe omakase concept shld be more commonplace to allow eateries to #reducefoodwaste) 
Chef shared that a full veg course can also be very satisfying. However, I'm still thinking doesn't it mean it may need to be this level of cooking to be so? (see regular veg stalls). A simple meat dish could easily satiate already. A separate topic on values vs desire. 
#guifm2019 #keepkampungalive #groundupinitiative @anonymised_user #foodwaste #uglyfood 
Thank you @anonymised_user and @anonymised_user 
Menu:
Drinks: Lemongrass and pandas tea 
Pre-Appetizers: Sourdough & Foccacia with curry leaf butter
Appetizers: Veggie patty with basil vinaigrette, sauces of tomato chutney and soy aioli
Main dish: Nasi Ulam kamameshi with rebdang oyster mushroom, potato & capsicum. Sides are tempura of corn, maitake and eggplant and pickled cucumber & radish 
Dessert: a sweet savory mix of salted coconut agar topped, carrot halwa, orange reduction and walnut crumble. Bonus serve of fuzzy melons with two weeks brewed enzyme sauce for gut health"

Handmade Specially for You 
Thank you for friends who love to protect our mother nature and starting their eco friendly journey by reducing & replacing plastic.  Thank you for friends keep ordering handmade Beeswax Wrap with us. 
JC's Beeswrap cannot compare to store bought , because the beeswax we are using were bought directly from Bees Farm with honey fragrance.  They are raw natural  beeswax without adding other ingredients nor processed to be lighter colour.  Whenever I handmade at home bees  will fly into my unit  
About the fabric we specially hand selected pc by pc from Kazakhstan (100% cotton ) , Singapore and Hong Kong (Bamboo Fabric) 
About the Formula , it is specially formulated with different combination of oil, beeswax and resin from JC Cheng's experienced, she keeps improving since year 2016 when JC start making and teaching in workshop. 
JC Cheng using hotpot method , this method the wrap are thicker therefore it can last longer , if they got many crack line after many years in and out of fridge, just replenish the 3in1 beeswax block provided in each purchased more than 6pcs, this beeswax block is for your replenish when your wrap wear off. 
ALL the above 4 reasons make JC Cheng 's Beeswax Wrap very special **NO PLASTIC in most of my delivery packaging. **5% off for order more than 6pcs. 
When you know how to replenish after several yrs using it.  Probably this can be a lifetime reusable unless like one of my big 60x60cm got bite and tear off by my dog like her toys   
Have you start your Eco Friendly Journey yet ?  At least try to refuse using Plastic Straw, reduce plastic bag usage but BYObag,l & BYOcup.

43646,"Several weeks ago, @anonymised_user asked about compost temperatures. 

At the time, the Bukit Gombak compost makers were learning to build a pile using their senses - how to balance the proportions of carbon and nitrogen ingredients by sight, developing a sense of when to add water during the process, observing the kinds of microorganisms as a way of pulse-checking, and feeling the temperature by thrusting their hands into the pile at the start of every session, to gauge the level of bioactivity. 

It is a way of learning by first building and developing an inner knowing and honing one's instincts to obtain feedback and confirmation, before relying on external tools. 

Today, for the first time, we did the customary temperature-taking with a compost thermometer. Well, with four actually. I was testing a batch of thermometers - one for each neighbourhood and a spare, just in case. And sure enough, we have a rogue one whose reading went weirdly off the charts (can you spot it in the photo?)

Brian's comment was that at 80 degrees Celsius, the heat kills off microbial life in the compost. 

Absolutely. Even at 60 degrees Celsius, beneficial microbes are starting to die off. It's an event no compost maker wants; the purpose of making compost IS to cultivate bacteria and fungi to feed the soil, so achieving the ideal bioactive temperature range is key. 

So Brian, I'm pleased to say the compost is happily humming along in the higher end of the bioactive range - around 53 degrees Celsius . 

Actually I could go on for longer about compost temperatures and the different kinds of organisms that appear when the compost goes into different temperature ranges. Definitely a topic for another post

43648,"Compost-making is not all gym work and kitchen prep with pitch forks, shovels and lots of cutting up of stuff. It can be as senang as bury and go. 

At Bukit Gombak, we recently started another way of making compost - the trench, named after a method used by Mr Tang, an active compost-maker and regenerative farmer in Singapore. It is a systematic way of burying food scraps in trenches dug into the ground.

But in this instance, instead of breaking ground, we piggybacked on the compost we had already made. While the bottom half of the compost pile is left undisturbed to mature, the top half will be used for trenches. 

The compost is fluffy; the compost makers just use their hands to make a trench and drop in the food scraps. Cover up with a thick layer of compost, and we are done. No tossing is required. At the next session, we make a new trench and repeat. Too easy.

What about adding new carbon ingredients? Well, there's no need for that because the existing compost pile, while still maturing for the next couple of months, has enough carbon to satisfy the most voracious mircrobes! So there's no worry about anaerobic conditions setting in. 

With this set-up, the compost-makers at #regentgreenscommunitygarden now use two methods: open pile and trench. 

They now have loads more capacity to receive much larger quantities of food scraps from more households in the estate. 

And so we are ready to head into uncharted waters for the next phase of our adventure - how to attract more households to become active foodscrappers. 

That is the part I have been waiting to explore; nutrient-cycling and closing the loop means a lot to me personally.  A meeting with the residents of the condo is in the works. Stay tuned!

A total of 70kg of food scraps and a smorgasbord of carbon ingredients found within the estate (no soil was added) will now sit and mature, and become the test bed for another method of composting. 

More of that coming up in another post.

43655,"Compost [?] a good fluffing!

Why: The micro-organisms in the compost thrive on oxygen. After a week of intense eating, reproducing and pooping, these guys would have burned up lots of oxygen (so producing lots of heat). By tossing and mixing up the compost, we introduce fresh oxygen and the party continues for another week!  

How do we know the compost is active and healthy?

By sight: Fluffy texture and lots of micro-organisms scurrying about. 
By smell: There is a pleasant earthy scent, and NO stink.
By touch: Gently moist, steamy and very very warm -  like a good chocolate cake fresh out of the oven.

What you won't see (yet): Earthworms, millipedes, centipedes, sow bugs - they don't show up in a hot cooking compost, but will later when the microbial party has died down and the compost enters its quieter maturing phase. 

Because the proportions of carbon and nitrogen ingredients were in balance, the compost was able to withstand the onslaught of rain throughout the week. It was not waterlogged, and retained a healthy internal heat.

43661,"Foodscrapping: a word not found in any dictionaries. 
*
Confession: We made up the word
*
Because we believe the act of segregating, collecting, prepping and storing food scraps is a vital sister act to compost making, and an even more important step in diverting food scraps, a treasured resource, away from our waste streams and back to nature.*
*
So this act deserves its own name 
*
Foodscrapping is not as rare in Singapore as you may think. In fact, there are more private individuals who want to give food scraps than there are compost makers (also private individuals) who can take them in. *
*
Which made us think it is definitely time to collectively re-imagine community composting in Singapore

43857,"@anonymised_user - Is Indonesia's hydroponic scene THAT game-changing?  

Eat Me sells hydroponic grown fruits & vegetables. From salad mixes to golden melons, all their produce is pesticide-free and grown in West Jakarta's @anonymised_user Mini greenhouse boxes are available at select supermarkets for customers to pick from.

Review [?]
Their vegetables are good but not so differentiated from other hydroponic brands in the supermarket. There are more organic brands popping up in Indonesia so their quality and taste are all similar. My issue is Eat Me's plastic packaging is super wasteful. Even their pre-cut salad bowls aren't reusable!
@anonymised_user 

Eat Me's packaging is attractive but I try not to buy fresh produce from the supermarket. It's more expensive and the packaging is wasteful. Instead I buy my produce from @anonymised_user on @anonymised_user because they come directly from the farms (they're not a hydroponics farm). Even though there is an occasional worm in the spinach and the broccoli turns yellow faster, I don't mind because they don't use pesticides. They even refund your money if you don't think your vegetables are fresh enough.

... I forgot to post dessert ! So I'm back (in a jiffy) with more Covid 19 cooking crusades. This time with VIDEO.

On the menu, cupcakes and blueberry crumble from a fab online cooking with pennies recipe!  Btw, I checked that stat on the amount of food thrown away in Singapore. It's close to 4 million dollars worth of food across all households here according to @anonymised_user 

Enjoy my simple yet colourful video of some of the process in creating dessert!

So I've been cooking! The COVID 19 circuit breaker had us under lockdown in Singapore for two months so comfort food was the order of the day. 

Some of my culinary escapades included an old NY favourite, huevos, patties, a Ceylonese curry puff much like a Greek toropita,  bruschetta, olive or garlic oven roasted salmon with capresse salad, Spanish Gambas or Cajun shrimp with guacamole and berry based and boosted smoothies! 

Leftovers from these make for a great home packed lunch at work the next day in the fight against food waste. Singapore's food waste stats jumped 20 percent in the last 10 years according to the @anonymised_user I buried the lead on this post clearly ! 

Have a thoughtful and deliciously nice day!  #FoodWaste #PlantBasedCooking #SeafoodProtein"

Throwback Tuesday to one of my last beach clean ups, before the Singapore COVID 19 circuit breaker kicked in. This one in Sembawang. 

Singapore disposed of nearly 3 million tons of waste last year, 30 per cent of which was plastic and 20 per cent food waste according to the @anonymised_user 

Beach clean ups to the rescue @anonymised_user @anonymised_user ! 

We rescued a horse shoe crab VIDEO) while clearing a tons of trash (VIDEO) on Sembawang beach. 

A big shout out to those who run these environmental initiatives and those who volunteer. Hoping we'll be back on seaside shores soon enough once the different phases ease us back to life post COVID-19. For now even if we are just a team of 5 under current regulations works for me !

57618,"Posted @anonymised_user * @anonymised_user A big #christmasgift is coming from New York City-based startup #C16Biosciences who is working to develop a synthetic alternative to #palmoil with similar chemical and functional properties to the original! 

This alternative would mean that foods and other products could still have that creamy/smooth texture we all adore, but without the cost of burning down or clearing any rainforest. The startup hopes their product could eventually replace natural palm oil in everything from shampoos, soaps, detergents and lipsticks, to endless food products. This would be a huge stride in #endingdeforestation and #protectingourplanet since palm oil is the world's most-produced vegetable oil with a global yield of 75.7 million metric tons entering the market every year (mostly sourced from tropical/highly biodiverse regions).

 So what is the secret to this process? At C16 Biosciences this involves using genetically-engineered microbes to convert #foodwaste and industrial by-products via fermentation into a product that is chemically very similar to natural palm oil. Not only could this product be a huge asset for #savingorangutans, but it also could be a huge #sustainabledevelopment! Plus heavyweights such as Richard Branson and Bill Gates have already invested.
 
 What do you think about this new product? Do you think it has the potential to go all the way and help save our forests, or do you think it is not enough? We'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments!"

62728,"Food waste is a pertinent concern in land-scare Singapore that has no natural resources. To kick start the new year, CDL was pleased to organise a robust and candid discussion on food waste minimisation in Singapore, at the Singapore Sustainability Academy. The forum attracted over 80 participants, and featured expert speakers from across the public, private and people sectors:
- Mr Ron Wong, Deputy Director, Waste and Resource Management Department, @anonymised_user - Mr Nicholas Ng, Co-Founder, @anonymised_user - Ms Chitra Venkatesh, Head of Education and Network leader, @anonymised_user - Mr Tan Szue Hann, Managing Director, @anonymised_user - Mr Tyler Jong, Co-Founder, @anonymised_user - Mr Max Yeo, Sales Manager, Zero Waste Solution

It was heartening to see that there was general consensus that the government was stepping up on efforts to address food waste in Singapore. While more can be done, other players such as businesses and the people can do their part to further reduce food waste not just down stream (eg food waste redistribution, recycling, and composting), but also upstream (eg accepting 'ugly' fruits and vegetables, mindfully reduce over-purchase of food).  With greater collaborative efforts across all sectors, we can all collectively change mindsets, values and behaviours to help prevent food waste in Singapore!

Ngl, I was eagerly waiting for the delivery driver to come with my order. The thought that my amazing takeaway food would be delivered in #reusablecontainers with almost #zerowaste generation was just really exciting.  Highlight of my #circuitbreaker . .

Was quite confused after I got the containers on how to add them to the app inventory so that I could do a proper return later on so I had to ask for help from the kind folks at @anonymised_user .

BUT YALL CAN READ A LABEL. BUT DO YALL KNOW HOW THE LABELS ALIGN WITH YOUR VALUES?!

I went down the rabbit hole a while back about what Organic labeling really meant and the takeway was you can be organic and an uncertified farmer without the funds to get the certification. But you can also get the certification and 'do organic' differently than the next farmer. It's inconsistent, but at least it helps consumers choose as responsibly as they can. And you gotta be able to tell the difference  between legitimate labels and greenwashing...!!

.
.
I have mixed feelings about refilling, mostly because of the affordability of it for certain households. I am fortunate enough to be able to afford a product that may be better for the environment but 2-5 times more expensive than the generic brands. But not everyone can afford to do so. .
.
Right now, am still exploring the balance between refilling certain products vs buying in bulk and ensuring that those containers can be recycled vs making my own.
.
.
Edit: After some thought I also realized that another refill option could be if those generic brands we normally bought offered refills. But because refill stations often focus on environmentally responsible brands too they're environmental a few ways- 1. replacing plastic containers but also by 2. providing biodegradable/better for the environment products. One might be more accessible to families than the other SOOO would love to see bigger companies also offer refill options locally as a good place to start!

As an apartment dweller it means A LOT to me to have a viable way to compost and many of the other compost hubs in my area were full.
.
.
.
It took quite a while to find the hub but once we found it they had all the necessary things to drop off, weigh, and record. Also this garden was much more out of the way than originally anticipated so will need to be more mindful of dropping off when I'm in the area vs driving ~8 miles round trip just to drop off scraps. It was inspiring seeing the list of names and how many lbs of food waste this hub was diverting though!

But with the news about domestic waste going up by 40% over the past 2 months, I couldn't justify buying takeaway with disposables! So what did I do?? I checked the list of vendors on the @anonymised_user app and found out that @anonymised_user was on it! I then proceded to get (not one) but BOTH of them for myself and my brother!  
 
They delivered it to my doorstep piping hot and the contactless QR scanning to check out my barePack containers were done in no more than 3 seconds.  
 
I was so happy with this treat I nearly forgot we were going through a pandemic.

74447,"As you carry away your takeaway lunch, did you know that 1/3 of domestic waste comes from SINGLE USE PACKAGING?                       
A study by the Singapore Environmental Council also found that approx 473 million plastic disposable items like takeaway containers were used in 2018. This does not even include plastic bags and PET bottles which were thrown away in the millions!!                       
For a population of 5.64million (2018) this is a shocking amount of rubbish generated from single-use items alone, and in many circumstances could be avoided.                                           
To help combat that, amazing initiatives such as @anonymised_user are here to help you reduce your single-use takeaway packaging and provide you with reusable takeaways while still keeping it convenient. Their sturdy, well designed lunch boxes and tumblers help you carry respectable amounts of food to and fro while keeping everything hygenic and safe with medical grade silicon and stainless steel metal. (Who wants to eat leeched plastic in their food anyway??)

74698,"Had the pleasure to vist the @anonymised_user store the other day which is Denmark's first surplus food supermarket. The store sells food and other goods that have either been damaged in the packaging process, had incorrect labels or which regular supermarkets can no longer sell as a result of overdue 'best before dates' but which nevertheless are still edible and safe to consume. On top of it, the goods found in the store are considerably cheaper than the usual market prize with all the proceeds going to the fight against famine. Kudos to the Danish Church Aid @anonymised_user who developed this excellent concept to reduce food waste and in turn also help to reduce the environmental costs of food production, distribution and consumption

 Happiest moment was seeing the huge smiles on the staff's faces! I didn't expect the reaction since donations come in everyday by the pallets. Guess the beetroots with their ruby hue, unruly leaves and diverse shapes & sizes deviated from the regular, uniformed foods that were mass produced and sadly, grown with wastage built in. There's nothing like crops that were grown for purpose and cared for with love

88785,"After reading the Hong Kong government's recent waste blueprint, we realised more ambitious targets are needed for the city to achieve ""zero landfill"" by 2035. 

And so on 25 March, we held an Open Think Tank to facilitate a constructive dialogue on improving #wastemanagement in Hong Kong, and helping the city transition towards a #circulareconomy. 

With the combined wisdom of hospitality business owners, sustainability experts, and other stakeholders in society, the Open Think Tank concluded with solutions that could help fill in the gaps in the government's waste blueprint.

For example, some hospitality business owners are already investing in alternative solutions to waste reduction, or hiring private contractors to #compost their #foodwaste. Instead of pouring funds into new and often short-lived projects, the government could accelerate the progress of waste reduction while promoting the creation of green jobs by investing in existing, proven solutions innovated or adopted by individuals and businesses.

88804,"PROJECT KICK-OFF ALERT! 

It is fair to say that Hong Kong is 'Waste Deep' in crisis.. 

The tourism & hospitality industry is one of Hong Kong’s economic pillars. However, the most recent measure trying to estimate the waste generated by the industry as a whole dates back to almost 20 years ago.
 
GREEN Hospitality, in collaboration with Eat Without Waste, will conduct an in-depth study to bridge knowledge gaps, build awareness, mobilize industry stakeholders, and encourage future research.
 
How, you ask? By measuring the share of waste generated by the industry and identifying pain points, barriers to implementation, and good practices that can be readily applied here in Hong Kong.
 
This is designed to help the various stakeholders within the hospitality industry to improve their waste management practices and to encourage them to measure and reduce their waste. 
 
Tune in on 25th Feb through Zoom to learn about our research process and opportunities to participate.

88843,"Today is the World's Food Day, which is held annually on 16 October as designated by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). World Food Day promotes global awareness and action for those who suffer from hunger and for making healthy and sustainable diets more affordable and accessible. 

In Hong Kong, we are facing an enormous challenge with food waste - especially lack of space to store it and a capacity to recycle it. Almost 90% of food waste is being exported to China, according to Reuters News Agency. Many people lack access to sufficient food even in Hong Kong so reducing food waste is essential in making it available to those who need it.

88845,"The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) has launched a pilot programme for a smart recycling system, attempting to soft-launch the smart recycling facilities in the community gradually. 

Initially, the smart recycling system will be installed on a Community Smart Recycling Vehicle (CSRV) to collect the four most common recyclables - waste paper, plastic, metal and glass. 

You don't have to measure and record the weight of recyclables collected - ALL can be done with automation. An overflow alert is installed to optimize bin usage and management efficiency.

The CSRV is now travelling around various districts for the public to visit and try out the new system. The EPD's outreach teams for waste reduction and recycling will also educate the public on-site. 

Try it out next time you see it in your neighbourhood!

Launched earlier this week by Wrap UK, which works with governments, businesses and communities to move towards a sustainable and resource-efficient economy, the Guardians of Grub campaign aims to reduce the amount of food wasted across the sector by 100,000 tonnes per year by 2025. 
From a seven-day tracking sheet to food tracking calculator, the campaign aims to inspire action at every level of the hospitality and food service profession, from kitchen porter to business owner and across preparation and service, helping them see that everyone has the power to reduce food waste.

""The birth of the NUS Buffet Response Team (BRT) began when we noticed significant amounts of leftover catered food at events around NUS often being thrown away.We’re firm believers in finishing every grain of rice and sought this win-win solution to combat the issue of wasted leftover food. It serves as a platform where students, can save money and at the same time, reduce food wastage. 
It’s still shocking to see huge trays of food being posted on the BRT. However, whenever we see our group grow or students heading to get the food, we are heartened to know that we’re making a difference not just in reducing food waste, but also in bringing smiles to our members’ faces. 
Reducing food waste in Singapore starts with you and I. Apart from encouraging people to reduce food waste on an individual level, we would also like to encourage enthusiastic individuals to start up similar BRTs be it in their schools or offices."" Fun Facts:
🍗 NUS BRT began in October 2015

Boil onion skins for 20 minutes and strain out the liquid. Drink it as tea before bedtime to help relieve muscle cramps.

5. Vegetable Broth

Make your own homemade vegetable broth with kitchen scraps such as onion skin. Onion skin adds extra nutrients in the broth. Strain the papery skin out before consumption. 
6. Onion Skin Powder

Roast onion skins at 230℃ for 30-40 minutes. Grind the roasted skin to powder and use sparingly to flavour your dishes.

100903,"What have we been doing to the peels of onions and garlic that we will usually toss away? We can put them to a better use rather than trashing it. 
Onion skin is a good source of antioxidants that is rich in quercetin – a flavonol that can reduce blood pressure and prevent arterial plaque that can cause stroke.

Note: Use organic to avoid ingestion of pesticides sprayed on the outer layers of the skins.

1. Onion Skin Fertiliser 
Add 2-3 handful of onion skin into 1 litre of water for 1-2 days. The water will be coloured and thick. Strain out the liquid and use it as a liquid fertiliser. Use it once every 15 days either diluted with water to onion liquid ratio of 1:1 or without dilution.

2. Composting

If you’re not doing vermicomposting, drop the onion skins deep into your compost bin to get a nutrient-rich compost. *Earthworms hate onions and similar odorous substances

3. Mulching

Add onion skin to the surface of soil, it will decompose soon and enrich your soil with potassium and calcium, which is so good for plant growth. *Mulch is a layer of material applied to the surface of soil for benefits like preserving soil moisture and reducing weed growth.

100907,"Upcycling Eggshells #3 - Cleaning Agent

6. Non-Toxic Abrasive Cleaner
Add ratio of 1 eggshell powder to 3 baking soda, mixed them with water to clean pots and pans (with baked-on food), shower doors (with months of gunk), toilet bowl rings and grout.

For narrow/long-necked containers, add crushed eggshell with water. Let it stand for a few days giving it an occasional swirl before rinsing.

7. Laundry Whitener
Add eggshells into a muslin bag (secured tightly) and add it to your white laundry. Eggshells are porous and they absorb stains easily.

6. 无害清洁剂
把1勺蛋壳粉对3勺的苏打粉的比例调好粉末。把粉末加入适量的水，混成糊状，清洁剂就完成。清洁剂适合用来清洗锅，浴室门，马桶底座的边缘和缝。

实用在窄颈或小口瓶子／容器时，可将1-2颗的蛋壳碎片跟水倒入容器，放置2-3天，偶尔搅动一下就能清除掉难洗的污垢。

7. 洗衣漂白剂
把蛋壳放入棉布袋中，绑紧袋子后把它丢入洗衣机里跟衣服混着洗。蛋壳的微细孔能轻易的吸收污垢。

4. Remedy for Insect Bites
Soak eggshells in apple cider vinegar for a few days, then the mixture can be used on insect bites. When the shell breaks down, calcium carbonate will react with vinegar to form calcium acetate, an astringent like calamine lotion.

5. DIY Facial Mask
Mix an egg white with eggshell powder and apply as a facial mask.

4.  昆虫叮咬治疗剂
可将蛋壳和水果醋/醋浸泡3到5天的液体涂抹在被昆虫咬的皮肤上。蛋壳的碳酸钙分解后就会和醋产生醋酸钙。醋酸钙的作用就像炉甘石洗剂能止痒。

5. 面膜
将蛋白和蛋壳粉搅拌混均即可敷上脸部。如果皮肤感到不适，请用清水把面膜洗掉。

100909,"Waste not… want not…. To the majority of us, eggshells are simply rubbish. However, eggshells are very useful resources which can be upcycled for different purposes, as shared in our posts. *Do wash/boil the eggshells clean. 
Upcycling Eggshells #1 - Garden Hero

1. Organic Pest control
Crushed eggshells can be sprinkled around the base of plants which deter slug and snails etc.

Lizards dislike the smell of eggs, thus leaving them around the house will ward unwanted lizards at home (wipe shells dry instead of washing them). 2. Fertilisers
Crushed eggshells add calcium to the soil when they decompose. It works well for eggplants, peppers, tomatoes and other plants that are susceptible to blossom-end rot.

3. Starter Pots for Seedlings
Eggshells can be used as starter pots for seedlings, before transplanting them in whole, into the garden. Crush the shell gently to allow the seedlings’ roots to grow into the surrounding soil.

废物利用，在循环之蛋壳系列

鸡蛋应该算是多户家的必备食材。我们通常用了鸡蛋就会把蛋壳丢掉吧？其实蛋壳能通过废物利用衍变成有用的资源而且还能减少垃圾。想一想，如果每个人都尽一份力，垃圾量会逐渐的减少。

以下是教导大家使用再循环蛋壳的方式，大家不放试试看。
注意事项：使用蛋壳前，要清洗/煮沸。

1. 天然的抗虫剂
在花盆底部或周遭撒上压碎的蛋壳有效的防止蛞蝓、蜗牛等的爬虫。若要防止壁虎，只需把清洗干净的蛋壳在屋内各个角落摆放既可。

2. 肥料
撒在土壤上的蛋壳碎片在分解后会变成钙。这会帮助果例如茄子、辣椒、番茄等的 蔬菜的生长。

3. 育苗盆
把幼苗放入蛋壳里培育，时间成熟便可把蛋壳轻轻压碎，把幼苗蛋壳一起放到入土壤里种植。

100922,"Last Saturday, I went to Carnival @ Park to find out more about the closed-looped urban farming system which Tampines Park will be piloting.

A dialogue session with our MP Masagos Zulkifli, Jonathan from Otolith and our RC coordinator gave a clearer picture of what will be taking place. 
Over the next few months:
1. Food waste of residents will be collected and fed to the larvae of black soldier fly (BSF)
2. Larvae of BSF will be fed to the fish, while excreta from the larvae will be used to fertilise vegetables in the vertical farm 
3. Vegetables and tilapias will be harvested, closing the circular system.

I’m really excited that such an initiative is happening over at our community and I’ve the opportunity to volunteer for it. 
Not only are we able to reduce our food waste significantly, and we are able to consume our local produce too!

Will share more when I’ve the chance. Till then.

100947,"Did you know that food waste is worse for climate than plastic? In Singapore, only 17% of the food waste is being recycled.

Instead of throwing away our fruit peels, we can turn them into Eco Enzymes; a multipurpose liquid that is produced from the fermentation of organic waste. This liquid can be used as mopping liquid, kitchen cleaner, fruit and vegetable cleaner, insect repellent and plant fertilizer etc.

Supplies needed
- Sugar
- Fruit peels (which are not cooked)
- Plastic container

Method
Prepare an empty plastic container, date and label it.
Fill the container with:
A) 10 parts water (rain water, tap water, upcycle rice water)
B) 1 part sugar (white/brown/jaggery/gula melaka/coconut/palm/molasses/expired ones is OK)
C) 3 parts fruits peels/waste
Stir the mixture properly. Leave some air space.
Close the lid of the container.

Aftercare
During the 1st month of fermentation, open lid daily to stir the mixture and release gas.
During the 2nd & 3rd month of fermentation, open lid once a week to stir the mixture and release gas. 
After 3 months, the enzyme is ready to be used. Using a sift/cloth, filter the residue and the remaining liquid is ready to be used. The residue can be kept as a fertiliser or the next fermentation.

114191,"Kefir ///
.
.
Like something from a David Lynch movie, Kefir grains are very much alive! I haven't bought yoghurt since going low-waste earlier this year. Kefir is a yoghurt-like fermented drink and has a slight sour refreshing taste. I was given these Kefir grains by a fellow Abingdon Carbon Cutter, so I decided to give it a go. I don't normally drink cows milk due to being lactose intolerant, but surprisingly my digestive system has been able to handle cows milk kefir. .
.
It's really easy to make - just put the kefir grains in a jar & top up with fresh milk, cover with a muslin cloth, and leave at room temperature for around 24hrs. It will start to thicken as the kefir grains feed off the sugar in the milk. Scoop out the kefir, rinse with filtered water and repeat. My husband & children think I'm weird, but I'm having fun! .

114199,"Skin, stems & stalks ///
.
'Roughly one third of the food produced in the world for human consumption every year — approximately 1.3 billion tonnes — gets lost or wasted. Food loss and waste also amount to a major squandering of resources, including water, land, energy, labour and capital and needlessly produce greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global warming and climate change.' Food & Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.
.
.
I'm glad to say that I've always been efficient with my groceries and I seldom have to throw anything out. I have a small fridge so it's easy to keep track of the contents. However my zero-waste culinary attitude includes the skin, stem & stalks. .
.
I have a disagreement with my husband over what you can eat vs what you want to eat vs. what you should eat. I was brought up devouring every scrap - the skin, the giblets, the bone marrow, (and my favourite) the crunchy cartilage. My parents are huge fans of fish heads and the eyes were a delicacy. In my opinion, potato skins were the best part of a jacket potato. Bread crusts, pizza crusts and the 'end piece of the loaf' were in high demand in my childhood. My brother used to love the crispy bits of fried noodles stuck to the pan. Much to my husband's dismay when he thinks a jar of peanut butter or jam is finished, I am a master of carefully scooping out every last morsel without leaving a smudge. Before I even knew about the design of the marmite jar, I would fill my near-empty jars with warm water to make stock. I  rarely cook meat these days but love fish, especially the skin when it's crispy. .
.
Now that I have my own family, I'm teaching my children that it's perfectly normal to eat every part of a vegetable. I made this meal using 10 different vegetables that included radish leaves, broccoli stalks, spinach stems, and homemade pesto made using carrot tops. It tasted deliciously wholesome, and packed full of nutrients. .
.
I'll end on this statement by the FAO '2.3 billion people are joining the planet by 2050 – this will require a 60-70% increase in global food production. Or we can just stop throwing away our food!'

Different dishes call for different types of rice - long grain, short grain, sticky, fragrant, high fibre. We have so many types in the kitchen to cater to different needs.⁠
⁠
Take your pick and order the amount you need. Always wanted to try a new type of rice but unsure if you will like it? Watching your diet and cutting down on carbs? Have a small family and can't finish a pack of rice? You can buy as little as 100g from The Bare Essentials. ⁠

126448,"Not Tony Stark's I Love You 3000, but the amount of food waste in 🇸🇬 in 2018. You read that right, we created a whopping amount of food waste equivalent to the weight of 54,000 double decker buses. 
Food waste translates to ~ more 🍚🥦🍈🍗 imports to meet demands, ~ more waste disposal facilities to incinerate the waste ~ waste of resources from the entire supply chain ~ waste of money to purchase food which we eventually throw away

Half of household food waste generated can be prevented by ✅ Buying only what you need. That's exactly what The Bare Essentials is here to do. Allowing you to buy as much or little as you need so you don't need to worry about expired or stale food sitting in your food cupboard or fridge ✅ Cooking or ordering the right amount ✅ Sharing excess food with neighbours or donating them ✅ Turning leftovers into a new dish ✅ Proper food storage

 20 g hazelnut almonds, or walnuts ( I personally add almonds)
 50 g spruce radish leaves (you'll get plenty of it with a standard radish bunch)
 100 g of olive oil
 salt.
INSTRUCTIONS
 Wash carefully, then squeeze the tops of a radish bunch.
 Place in the bowl 1 or 2 cloves garlic peeled and a piece of 30 g parmesan.  Mix 10 seconds / speed 8.
 Add 20 g almonds, 50 g radish tops, 100 g olive oil and a large pinch of salt.  Mix again 10 seconds / speed 8, or even a few more seconds if you think it necessary.
 The pesto is particularly delicious when it is fresh, but it will keep a few days in a jar closed in the fridge if you make sure to cover its surface with olive oil to protect it from oxygen.

134712,"Made a spontaneous decision to pack lunch today. I’m so grateful that our meals fitted in just 2 containers! Lesser stuff to wash 🤣. Walked into a cozy cafe and then I realized I forgot to bring my flask. I ordered a cup of iced coffee and contemplated if I should just watch the barista scooping ice to put into a plastic cup. Then I stopped her in a nick of time and asked her if she is comfortable using a food bag instead. I was pretty shy about it because her glorious shiny coffee machines kinda made me feel slightly intimidated. Hahaha. Luckily, she is open to the idea so I unfolded my 3L #pockeat and passed it to her .
.
.
Honestly, my pockeat is 3L size and I find it not ideal to drink from there because I can’t easily stick a straw in unlike the 2L size. I also had fried radish in the bag previously. Was pretty worried that my coffee would taste garlicky & funky. Anyhoo—long story short, everything was a success. I had a lovely conversation and experience in the cafe. The barista learned something new today and my coffee tasted just fine! Win-win .

✅ 2 paper food boxes

✅ 1 plastic bag
✅ 1 plastic cup with plastic lid

Nonetheless I’m excited that I made my first sourdough or bread for that matter! We had a very good instructor who sent us step-by-step pics and videos throughout the process. She was also very patient and answered all our very-basic questions.

Wasn’t expecting such a long process that started a day before when we had to feed our starter yeast. We started making the dough at 10am and didn’t end till 6.30pm!

Next time please savour and appreciate every piece of bread that goes into mouth and don’t waste food! I don’t care if it means you have to scoop up all the bread crumbs. There’s so much love, sweat, effort and time that goes into making every piece of bread that it’s not right to throw anything away!

159278,"How much food could a foodchuck chuck if a foodchuck could chuck food?

Now you might be wondering what the heck is a foodchuck? Just keep reading. 
It is difficult for any freegan to be alone. Freegans normally come in packs or communities. Like wolves. That’s because it’s more fun. It’s more fun to dumpster dive as a group, and also because of the sheer amount of stuff we get. 
Freegans in Singapore generally focus on either food or merchandise. I like food, which is why most of my posts here are about food. There’s also a practical reason:

Distribution

Food distribution and merchandise distribution are two different worlds. Primarily because food spoils a lot faster than merchandise. If you’ve set up your home for merchandise and someone drops off a whole load of food, you panic. And vice versa. 
Some freegans are primarily dumpster divers. They take the best of what they find, and pass on the rest via distributors. Distributors get second pick, and decide how best to pass on the haul. 
I’ve traditionally played both roles of collector and distributor, but now have shifted more into a distribution role. Basically a distributor needs to have the patience to sort and the capability to push out the collection before it spoils and goes to waste. 
I get my family members involved to distribute, while I handle the sorting. Most of our recipients are our neighbours and migrant workers. It is our form of charity. 
Because we don’t wanna be a foodchuck and have to chuck this food away. So we give. We eat of course, but there’s only so much we can eat. So we give and we give.  And that makes us happy. 
#reducefoodwaste #sgfoodrescue"
159280,"I really enjoy organising Little India Veggie Hunts. This is the activity that started it all. This was where I first discovered the tip of the iceberg that food waste in 🇸🇬 is. 
It’s important to go back to the roots. Veggie Hunt is a great introduction to the problem of food waste. 
In the past we used to dumpster dive to collect veggies, but we have since established relationships with the shopkeepers at this row of grocers. Now they happily give to us all the produce that they are going to throw away. 
Our night-time Veggie Hunts are still not as regular as I hope they would be. Primarily because this activity takes place late at night, so we would not be able to go home on public transport unless night buses were in operation. That limits this activity to Fri and Sat nights, unless those who drive were to join us. 
The other problem is that we almost always collect too much food, as you can see from our photos. The quality of the food is poorer as compared to the food we collect at the wholesaler level. So sometimes even charities don’t want to receive them. Most of it gets channeled to the freegan community, because we’re experts at reusing. 
I like Veggie Hunt because I conduct it in an educational format. The emphasis is not just to rescue food that is going to be thrown away, but also to spend some time in reflection on this problem of food waste. 
#sgfoodrescue #reducefoodwaste"
159281,"Since young, my mum has always said that I’m rather extreme when it comes to my eating habits. When I like to eat something, I would eat a lot of it until one day, I get sick of it and wouldn’t touch that food again for a very long time. .
It would seem that freegan living suits my eating habits, since I regularly get loads of one type of food. .
Thank god for a community of freegans! I would never be able to finish eating all these on my own!

159282,"Hadn’t done this in a while. Actually this is probably only my second time doing this. This = checking out what a supermarket throws away. .
When a friend told me she found fishballs, I was astonished. That’s probably just the tip of the iceberg. Indeed the fishballs were still cold when we found them. .
We also found 2 sacks of leafy vegetables but they were mostly spoiling so we just threw them back where we found them. .
We gave 3/4 of this away and restocked our fridges with the rest. .
My mum said, “These are the ones I buy from the supermarket!” Now she gets to try all the other brands. Now she gets to eat fishballs till we’re blue in the face. That should put us off buying fishballs for a while. .

159285,"Tonight I led a group of mostly NUS students for a Veggie Hunt at Little India. I used to do these almost every other week a few months ago, but have since stopped because too many people wanted to go and I didn’t have the energy to manage so large a group each time. 
I’ve recently restarted this activity because it’s such a great introduction to food waste. I remember when I first did this, I was always amazed at how much discarded food was collected. 
But nowadays when I’ve worked my way up the food supply chain and seen how much more food goes to waste, the amount we collect here looks so little. 
Even so, it was more food than all 13 participants were willing to bring home. So I dug out a big shopping bag and loaded the balance of the brinjals, ladies fingers, bittergourds, and onions to bring home. 
I’ve placed them outside my flat for fellow freegans and neighbours to come collect for their own consumption. 
This is my own small way to reduce food waste and share my surplus with my little kampong.

159287,Brought a group of exchange students at NUS dumpster diving for veggies at Little India tonight. I haven’t done this in a while because I now collect from shopkeepers before the veggies land in the bin. But this activity is always a good introduction to food waste in Singapore.

176328,"A lot of us have been purchasing nut-based milk in a carton pack flown in from far distant countries. We have found that a pack can contain as high as over 90% filtered water, a tiny % of the main ingredient and a list of flavourings and additives to boost its taste, sweetness and to preserve it for longer so it can travel further to reach you.

This basically means we are paying for water and carton material to be flown round the world. 

We are fortunate to live in a country with an easy access to tasty tropical ingredients. Fresh coconut is sold in abundance in Singapore and 100% pure coconut milk can be made at home by you... or for greater convenience ready-squeezed ones from your local store are just as good. Simply add water to thin it down and it becomes the perfect accompaniment to breakfast oats.

Pure rich tasty unadulterated natural healthy freshness at a mere fraction of the price of an imported water-filled packed version.

Why not try it for yourself?

Addressing the fundamental problems of today - farming is tedious, the food value chain is environmentally unsustainable,  labour shortage in F&B is commonplace. Perhaps it's time for us to reimagine how we grow, process and consume food more optimally. 
We aim to set up an experimental platform where innovators can testbed their ideas relating to the future of food and agriculture, and integrate them into the full value chain. Current concepts that are being explored include 'zero-miles' food production, AI-enabled personalised diets, and robots that would augment the abilities of visually-impaired chefs.

Refilling our own containers reduces waste. 
How you ask?
Reusing our own containers over and over again wipes out the need for single use plastics 

Refilling our own containers allows us to buy just the amount of food we need which reduces food waste and saves money. 

1/3 of the worlds food population produced is wasted. With millions of people starving in the world and food waste adding to our carbon emissions, small lifestyle changes we can make the world of difference 🌎

184219,"Crap or Not? 🥦 
Grown in Turkey🇹🇷 packed in New Zealand 🇳🇿

There is a story to this one, I hope you take the time to read on...

While traveling in SW QLD last month, we found fresh fruit and veggies not only difficult to come by but very expensive. 

Keeping an eye on areas of fruit eye and the horrible mouse plague we kept our fresh food supplies low with a good supply of “just in case we breakdown” non perishables. 

On reaching Cunnamulla we needed to stock up as we we’re heading deeper in the outback. 

Craving anything green this product was our only choice. 

I was so shocked to see the food miles let alone the plastic packaging. Grown in Turkey then transported to NZ to be packaged, then to Australia and Cunnamulla in SW QLD. 

For us that live with fresh produce in abundance how can we poo who others for buying food with massive food miles. We can’t. 

Many outback towns are dying so it’s difficult to engage the community to set up community gardens, councils don’t have the money to run composting programs let alone gardens. 

My thoughts go out to people that don’t have a choice. For people living on stations can be a 200km round trip to the closest supermarket. 

Why live out there?
I spent part of my youth living on a sheep station and loved it. 

Its important to know that is where our beef patties and lamb chops are grown, not the supermarket shelf wrapped in plastic. 

With 1/3 of the worlds food produced wasted, let’s not waste food, rather rethink where it is grown and thank our farmers everyday.

Nothing better than picking strawberries and eating them for breakfast and my husband loves grazing while watering, this morning purple beans were on his menu. 😆

I love to create rooms within our garden, there’s the “fruit circle “ where we have eaten and shared many meals and drinks with friends and family, conversations on all sorts of topics and a fair dose on bullshit. 

There’s my private place for yoga and meditation that I share with the birds and the occasional 🚗 but generally really quiet 🤫 

I turn 57 this year and it’s my year to #giveupcrap to buying it, calling it out and sharing ways to reduce our carbon emissions. 

There’s no high tech stuff, it’s all been built from repurposed stuff and sweat. It really is a case of “less is more”.

Into a cooler bag and we’re ready to travel. To avoid leaf burn wrap an ice block in cloth.  Use repurposed elastic bands to hold bundles together, if necessary. 

Don’t buy them, repurpose from bunches of asparagus or herbs.

One saving grace the cups are compostable with PLA lids (plant based plastic)

Determined that the cups not be single use they are now repurposed and growing our food and can be composted when they wear out.

Silicon. . 
When I bought this silicon cover/fruit hugger, I didn't expect it to work well. BUT I've been using them instead of cling wraps or beewax wraps (that refuse to cling 😒), every other day now.. On carrots, cucumbers, apples, even onions. Perfect! 🤓👍
.
And the collapsible silicon container I bought from Seastainable saved me a ton of storage space. You can boil silicon with some white vinegar to sterilise them. Though, they should not be used for storing food that are greasy or too acidic still.. The smell & grease will cling on (pun intended)..

221975,"'s New Year's message: This day marks a new decade, a decade that we will only hope to collectively survive by overcoming the challenges of severe overpopulation and climate change. The headlines for 1st January 2020 is a reminder that not all of us are ushering in the new year with drinks and merry. At present, people all over the world are losing their homes, families, and lives to firestorms, floods, droughts, famines, diseases, wars. As environmental conditions grow more extreme due to climate change, such occurrences will only increase in both scale & frequency. Cue the climate refugee crisis, mass food shortages, entire 'sinking' countries, and of course, the sixth mass extinction that's already underway. In the lap of our luxurious cities, do remember that the top 1.5 billion people in this world (that's us) consume about 75% of the world's resources, and the remaining 6 billion are aspiring to do the same. But we are already consuming 1.5 planet's worth of resources. We don't have 1.5 planets. By 2050, Earth is projected to host 9.8 billion humans. This equation is bound to collapse, along with humankind.

In the past few decades, human civilizations have developed rapidly using the power of unsustainable practices at the expense of other life forms, causing the anthropogenic mass extinction through massive habitat destruction and overexploitation of 6 out of 7 continents. And now, reaching saturation, our options into the future are limited. Perhaps it is time to review the fundamentals of our way of life. I'm being sarcastic, it's way past time. With 2020 knowledge & capability, we can create a sustainable lifestyle for every human, and even protect other lifeforms. But will we?

The answer lies with our actions in this new decade. So for your 2020 resolutions, give the next decade some thought.

PM me if you want some food for thought and hopes for the future, will be glad to share. #SomeHeadersForPersonalAction #Food #Transportation #Waste 
#SomeHeadersForCollectiveAction #Technology #Habitats #Policies"

237984,"Natural Bees Farm Beeswax 🐝♻️🙏🏽 Thank you for friends who bought Eco Beeswax Wrap with us♻️♻️💪🏼💪🏼 1. For friends whom bought JC’s BeesWrap with us , please kindly note , beeswax melting point is 62-68c , therefor not suitable to wrap very hot food, let the food cool down then you can use it as per any glad wrap or to cover yr Plate / Bowl. 
2. Cannot put in Microwave to reheat food together. 
3. yes there is some limitation however if you got any crack line or after many years of using them with some wear off you can keep replenish them and they will look like new again ♻️♻️💪🏼💪🏼. REALLY reusable for lifetime. 
4. For cooked warm food, pls wait till food cool down before wrap. 
5. We usually make wach set of order in different colour system, so end user can record and easy remember whic colour is for which food storing.  Please set your own storing syatem in the fridge.  Now you cannot see through so must remember what you have stored to reduce buying too much food and wastes. 
6. good to wrap fruits and veggies to store at fridge becuz beeswax wrap is breahtable, naturally anti-bacterial , can keep moist after wrap the veggies n fruits, they are water proof and oil proof , therefore can store veggies more than 7days still green and crunchy.  jist use them as any glad wrap or plastic bag.

7. Good for packed luck like sandwiches, snack, fruits and veggies. **We will soon available for friends who bought from us and need replenishing services, will keep you posted. 
Together we can make the difference ♻️♻️💪🏼💪🏼 #zerowasteliving #zerowastehome #reduceplasticwaste #reduceplasticbag #reusableecofoodwrap  #reusablebeeswaxwraps #washable #reusable #lifetimeusing #reducegladwrap #jcchenghandmade #jcchenghandcraft #ecofoodwrap #beeswaxwrap #ecofriendlyproducts #ecofriendlyliving #環保由我做起 #減少塑膠垃圾 #減少膠袋 #減少塑膠污染 #saynotoplastic"

If everyone who knows how to make Eco Enzyme if you can teach grandma or grandpa how to make it (since they are more free) and can sell to others who have no time to make it (they need to go to work) and in return grandma grandpa can get some extra $$ to buy more sugar to make more EE.  You are indirectly helping elderly to earn their own living. 
Can you imagine if you teach and share to some low income family to make EE then they can save $$ in buying detergent.  What a good and useful gift you have given to them. 
Can you imagine if everyone change using EE to replace chemical detergent, how much pollution reduced to our mother nature ?? **Not suggesting people to sell Eco Enzyme but for those who in need.  If you can please help to bless small amount to other beginner to try and inspired them.

Thank you sister and brother for ordering more Raw Vegan Chocolate Nut butter. 
Chocolate Nut butter even more work, becuz you need to prepare raw vegan chocolate before blending into the Hazelnut butter. 
Have keep trial and error for past 2years and still cannot make exactly like the Real Nutella !! I really starting to think what did they add in to make such creamy texture !! I only remember that they used Palm Oil that’s why many ppl refuse to purchase anymore, it is not eco friendly using palm oil. 
Since I only can use all real hazelnut and vegan chocolate (cacao powder & cacao butter) therefore it is different compare to commercial Nutella.  To make it more smooth thus added cashew nut blending together to given a more creamy texture.  That’s why family and friends recall more............ ended up busying making more Nutella today 😂😓😓............ok so now I got few extra of 120g per jar.  Anyone would love to try kindly PM me 🌿🌿🌱🌱 🌿all nuts soaked and activated
🌿 no sugar no dairy
🌿 plant-based, raw vegan

Behind the scene 
1. washed and Soaked to activate nuts overnight. 
2. hand pick away bad nuts. 
3. dehydrating nuts at 40c for 12-16hrs. 
4. after dehydrating still need to pick away bad nuts.
5. after picking away lots more cannot use to make Nut Butter. 
6. then a powerful blender into butter at low temperature.
7. to control the temperature is very challenging, becuz high speed blender always produce a high temperature heating up all ingredients therefore need to rest and blend aimed to maintain raw and vegan. **Remarks: soaking water from nuts can upcycle to watering plants more natural nutrition for homegrown plants. **Remarks: after pick away those bad nuts just upcycle into compost bin.

Recipes same as per any normal luncheon meat but replace meat by soy beans and almonds.  I did not measurement just follow my heart to cook but I add extra 5spices powder.  After adding red yeast powder it looks very like meat color.  Taste is very scrumptious (out of my expectation). 1. Either use a blender to blend all almond and soy beans or use a slow juicer.  The different is using slow juicer texture not chewy.  Blend the whole pc texture is better. 
2. I use slow juicer it is becuz the milk can use to make non dairy Milk Kefir, the residue use for making luncheon meat.

Our aim is to reduce food waste but upcycle them into another useful item (given food waste a 2nd life) to put them back into our mother nature.  Which I always keep sharing and educating around the world i.e. leading a living toward Circular Economy ♻️♻️💪🏼🌍 **Tips: If your teabag made of paper yes you can upcycle everything in your compost bin, however if they are made from plastic/nylon then cut it upcycle only the tea leaves inside.

蜂蠟保鮮布 28 Feb 2020
为什么蜂蜡布比较环保 ？
它可以代替保鮮紙及塑料袋的用法一模一樣,可不停重複重用￼￼而且我們可以升級再造家裏不要的布料做成蜂蠟布。

蜂蜡布有什么用途 ？
1. 到麵包店買麵包時，帶上自己做的蜂蠟布來打包帶走，減少單一次使用的塑膠袋。
2. 當保鮮紙用，整整齊齊包着市場買回來的蔬菜、水果存放在冰箱。
3. 做飯時，切開一半用不完的洋蔥、檸檬，包起來存放在冰箱。
4. 晚餐剩下的餸菜用作保鮮紙蓋在碗上或蓋在杯上。
5. 也可以用它來包午餐三文治呀、小食呀，水果呀 帶上學帶上班享用。

自從發明膠袋後，我們就什麼都用塑料袋了，所以現在我們不環保啦，而且製造了很多微塑膠在海洋，小動物的肚子裏也裝滿了我們的塑料袋啦 ！
所以啊，蜂蠟布其實是回到婆婆時代，也可以說是back to basic 返璞歸真了。

为什么蜂蜡布可以保鲜及保存食物 ？ 它有什么特质 ？
因為蜂蠟本身有抗菌，保濕及透氣的功能。 所以就算蔬菜存放在冰箱一個星期你會發現蔬菜還是很新鮮，還是脆脆綠綠的。  所以用它來 保存食物 或 pack lunch 打包午餐 是另一個更加環保的選擇。

4. 蜂蜡报的做法:-
有四种方法,

1. 用烤箱 (用作補充蜂蠟 或 只用蜂蠟的方法，比較浪費蜂蠟，難控制溫度)

2. 用熨斗 (用作補充蜂蠟 或 只用蜂蠟的方法）

3. 用掃 （較為麻煩）
4. 火鍋方法 （可以加椰子油， 最直接而且不會浪費蜂蠟，可以一次過做很多張而且可以做很大尺寸。

蜂蠟布只需要3 種很簡單的材料就能夠簡簡單單在家裏自己做：-
就是蜂蠟、沒有彈性布 和 椰子油。

1）蜂蠟 ， 天然材料， 保濕、抗菌、透氣。
顏色有很多種，有一些是比較黃有一些是比較深咖啡色， 在選擇的時候最重要就是有蜂蜜的香味，顏色應該是黃黃咖啡色的， 不應該是太深黑黑的。如果可以從蜜蜂場直接買回來通常是最天然的而且是比較便宜。 網購一定要找可信的公司。

2）椰子油 ， 因為比較天然，可以食用也是有抗菌功能。
任何食用椰子油就可以了。

3）任何 100% 純綿布 , 沒有彈性 ，支數少的布最適合比較薄。
升級再造任何家裏的 100%純棉布，或是竹纖維布， 或是任何不是太軟及較堅挺的布 就可以用來做了。 
4）有些朋友，喜歡加小量松樹脂 （食物級 optional 不一定需要), 能提供更有粘貼效果，但不是一定需要也可以做到蜂蠟布。

但是我希望大家也可以跟我一起做，所以我不建議特別去購買松樹脂。只有椰子油 和 蜂蠟 也可以做到 。 食用級的松樹脂比較難買而且網購最少1公斤，但是我們需要的只是 5-10gram, 所以不要為此特別去購買。 我個人認為沒有松樹脂也能夠做到粘貼效果。

所以需要買的材料只有蜂蠟 ！
希望大家能夠一起踏出一小步去幫助我們的地球拯救我們的下一代。 環保由我做起 ♻️♻️💪🏼💪🏼 #ecofoodwrap #beeswaxwraps #beeswaxwrap #zerowaste #zerowasteliving #zerowastehome #reduceplasticwaste #reducesingleuseplastic #reducesingleuseplasticwaste #環保由我做起 #蜂蠟布 #蜂蠟布diy #蜂蠟布代替塑膠袋 #蜂蠟布代替保鮮膜 #homemadebeeswaxwraps #ecofriendly #ecofriendlyliving #ecofriendlyproducts #reusablewrap #reusable #washable #antibacterial #透氣 #抗菌  #保濕 #bamboofabric #bamboofabricbeeswaxwrap"

Amasai / Milk Kefir Rolled Oat Facial Mask ☀️🌱🌿 So happened got little leftover more than 12days Amasai and Milk Kefir (300ml) plus going to expired rolled oat and sunflower seeds mix (30g). Therefore blend rolled oat into powder then blend egg, honey, lemon juice and Amasai separately.  Mix the in a glass jar (500ml). Quickly put it onto my face and cover with a paper mask so that I can walk around in the house and continue whatever I need to do.

Tips: after u added in milk kefir / Amasai into the blended rolled oat they will turn thicker and thicker gradually. 
Ingredients:-
1. unwanted rolled oat / oatmeal (nourishing) 
2. lemon juice (to whitening our black spot) 
3. honey (lock moist on our skin)
4. egg / egg white, optional esp not for vegan friends (whitening and collagen) 
5. Aleo Vera, optional (cut it from yr fresh plant, to help moisturising skin and lock moist). 6. Fermented Milk Kefir / Amasai Yogurt , this is the most important to nourishing and provide food for our skin. 
Mask Duration : 30mins - 1hr , rinse it off with plain warm water.

🌱🌎When you have too much abundant SCOBY !! 😱😱Recently many group friends asked me can they add Kombucha Scoby into our EE ?

ANS : Do not recommend and not necessary !! 1. we want our EE / GE turn into vinegar in a natural way through the natural wild fermentation,

2. Let the Nature do their job , wild fermentation needs only water, fruit wastes & sugar, do not need any other e.g. yeast powder or kombucha scoby !!!! 3. if you add scoby in yr EE they will eats up the sugar which may not enough for EE fermentation process to do their job. 
4. If you really have lots of KT Scoby pls watch the below video I made and learn how to make good use of them into Yummy Delicous and healthy Fruit Roll for your Pets and Kids ♻️🌱😃 5. If you have too much extra WKG (water kefir grains) or Scoby or Milk Kefir (not grains), you can use them all to feed our homegrow plants and or upcycle into your compost bin.

238633,"How Taiwan People start their waste segregation from origins ?  Part 2 
As mentioned in Part 1 , they have separate all their waste before passing to the garbage truck and the controller.  Whenever they coming to the residence area they will come by 2 truck together and playing music so that everyone can hear and will keep rushing out , if they missed then they have to wait for next schedule of garbage truck.  The most interesting why 2 different truck ?  The one in-front usually for food wastes and non recyclable waste, the one at the back for recyclable wastes, residence also need to segregation into plastic , paper, metal, glass for the recycle garbage truck.  The one in-front just need you to segregation into food wastes and other non-recyclable.  All these food wastes they will pass to pig farmer or veggies farmer for making into compost.  As mentioned many time Taiwan is a very small country and is an Island therefore they does not have enough land to do landfills.  This is main reason why they must take good care of their own wastes created.  Actually very similar to Japan , people from Japan and Taiwan do not wanted to  polluted their own precious land. #wastesegregation #wastesegregationeducation #ecofriendlyliving #greenliving #wastemanagement #zerowasteliving #foodwasterevolution #ecofriendly #wastesegregation #wastesegregationeducation #ecofriendlyliving #greenliving #wastemanagement #zerowasteliving #foodwasterevolution #ecofriendly #reduceplasticwaste🌏 #reduceplasticwaste #recycling #recycle #recycler #recycled #reuseplasticbottles #repurposed"
238634,"This is how Taiwan citizen throwing out their trash.  They do not have any cleaner to collect from your building / appartment / condo , they do not have any rubbish chute.  Therefore when they throwing out they must separate them before passing into the truck.  Whenever the rubbish truck arriving they play the music so everyone around thar area will know time to throw away their trashes.  Citizen need to separate into (1) recyclable item i.e. paper, plastic, metal, glass (2) general non recyclable i.e. plastic packaging bag, contaminated disposable items, napkin...... (3) food wastes.  You can see many residence keep coming out hurrying to pass to the controller at the back of the truck.  That controller will not collect if the trash he received is not properly segregated.  Therefore this is how Taiwan citizen/residence start their waste segregation from the origins.  I have asked the residence how frequently the garbage truck come to collect trash, they said different location have different schedule , some 3-4times a week some maybe 5-6 times a week.  #wastesegregation #wastesegregationeducation #ecofriendlyliving #greenliving #wastemanagement #zerowasteliving #foodwasterevolution #ecofriendly #wastesegregation #wastesegregationeducation #ecofriendlyliving #greenliving #wastemanagement #zerowasteliving #foodwasterevolution #ecofriendly #reduceplasticwaste🌏 #reduceplasticwaste #recycling #recycle #recycler #recycled #reuseplasticbottles #repurposed"

259825,"Vermicomposting Singapore-style Part 2: 

By letting compost worms express their natural wormness to move horizontally,* Oi Lian (our resident worm expert) realised it’s possible to house thousands of them comfortably in a single shallow drawer. She calls this method “side-migration”. 

In regular store-bought stacked worm bins, compost worms have to move vertically between tiers. Unlike burrowing earthworms that move up and down inside the soil, compost worms prefer to move sideways close to the surface, under the protection of some cover. Oi Lian harnesses this natural behaviour and adapts it to the drawer lifestyle.

Each drawer is a self-contained stand-alone worm bin. A tower of drawers becomes an effective and compact food scrap processing system that will sit happily in any shady corner of a garden, common corridor, or even in the house.

How effective? Oi Lian gets asked this a lot. She did some calculations - 16 drawers of worms can consume 80kg of food scraps and produce 20L of vermicompost. All in a month.

In fact, the worms are such mighty processors that Oi Lian regularly collects unsellable bruised fruits and vegetables from the market, to keep up with their appetite. 

Imagine the amount of food scraps, and unwanted fruit and vegetables (not to mention plastic drawers!) rescued from a fate in the incinerators. 

So this cute and easy system is not simply play play one. It really works and doesn’t cost the earth 😙. And the many who have learned from her to start their own worm drawers can attest to that.

259826,"Okay, so it turns out these mighty little eaters love AGED “black-listed” food; talk about a discerning palate!

Some examples of black-listed food for composting worms are citrus fruits, onions, garlic, capsicums, chillies, because their properties burn the worms’ skin. I mean, have you ever rubbed your eyes after cutting chillies, or inhaled onion fumes?🔥😱😭

 However, our resident worm expert, Liow Oi Lian, regularly feeds her worms these black-listed food scraps, such as citrus rinds, rinsed aloe vera bits, even chopped up capsicums and chilli. 

The secret is in the “how”. She leaves the contentious food scraps in a corner of the bin (not scattered all over like confetti), and lets the worms decide when to approach. When these scraps have aged sufficiently (many many days later), they become safe to consume. Then it’s an all out dash to the feast. Worms know their own minds and will choose when to travel to eat, I’m sure we can all identify with that 😉

259827,"Vermicomposting Singapore style 😀. Meet the Worm Drawers! An all-in-one food-scrap-to-compost waste management system hidden in a chest of drawers!
.
.
Thanks to the out-of-the-worm-bin thinking of one woman (more about that in another post), this system could now be yours! .
.
All you need to do is: rescue an abandoned stack of plastic drawers (quite abundant in Singapore, so keep an eye out) and make nice beds to welcome a batch of compost worms, who are cousins of the garden earthworm. .
.
How efficient is this system? Around 16 Drawers of worms (that’s about 8000 adult worms) will chomp through 80kg of plant-based food scraps each month. .
.
What’s in a worm’s feast? Household fruit and vegetable scraps, coffee grounds from kopitiams, fruit pulp from juice stalls, discarded “ugly” fruit from the market. These worms keep their concierge busy!
.
.
Why drawers? Because they have a small footprint, are so much easier to handle than the usual stacked worm bins (especially on older backs), and a great example of upcycling. .
.
Cool, hor? Stay tuned for more about this system and the woman who came up with it. She has been teaching it to local gardeners for many years. .

Simple #ricotta cheese using full cream milk, white vinegar and salt.
I like cheese but they are so expensive in the supermarket. So I thought try making the simplest one. Only technical part is heating the milk to the right temperature. Looks great and taste good. Advantage of making my own cheese is that I can do small portion, finish it within a week. In this way, nothing gets wasted and thrown away which so often happens with store bought cheeses. And the leftover whey from the cheese making is saved which I will use it to bake bread. Again nothing goes to waste. This cheese making is quite therapeutic and could become one of my weekend routine. Happy Days!😊🧀

This wouldn't have been possible without the consistent steps we took in following our curiosity and learning alongside the network that Food Citizen is a part of. There is much satisfaction in distilling insights and delivering them as authentically-delivered services to schools. 

Earlier this week, our team conducted a composting workshop for a school. The school was intrigued by the idea of auditing food waste in school, we were asked to integrate it in.

While we advocate for food waste audits, we had not participated in one ourselves. It was a personal triumph when we realised that what we knew was enough. With this internal shift, the creation of teacher's guide, student's worksheet and slides came naturally. We know that what we provided is of value to the school.

This is a quote that we shared. The workshop was online and 100 people called in. They included the school's vice principal, interested teachers, student leaders and climate action champs.

Every week we go thru kilos of lemons to make the juice we need for our dips... leaving us with a lot of lemon peels 🙄❓

😋 As you know most of the flavour and aroma is in the skin and it would be such a waste to throw away these precious yellow strips.

♻️ So we are trying our best to make use of them, wether it’s lemon vinegar, compost, zest for baking ...And whenever we can we make candied 🍋 peels.✨ ( available on request) 

💪 It’s a little work intensive between the washing, peeling, slicing and cooking. But it's the best feeling to make the most of what we have and reduce our impact on the planet. 🤗

👉 And you how do you use your lemon peels?

Your footprint matters. Growing your own food helps reduce footprint in so many ways. Start small and make a big change.

Growing your own microgreens are more sustainable from crops grown to maturity on large industrial farms. Many of today’s farms use pesticides and chemicals as inputs, and are often transported hundreds of miles to market. 

You can make microgreens even more sustainable using organic seeds and growing with natural energy. Happy Earth Day, everyone!

Growing up in Singapore, I remember waiting in anticipation as my Uncle in India would send us a box of the finest mangoes all the way from Mumbai (Bombay in those days). It was air flown (so it must have cost him an arm and a leg in those days) to ensure freshness because he always said his sister deserved the best. The mangoes were special because back then they weren't so readily available in Singapore.

Fast forward to present where almost every conceivable variety of mango - from Alfanso to Ratnagiri to Chousa - from India is so readily available. On the one hand, it takes away the uniqueness of the fruit but on the other, it allows us to celebrate the season for a much longer time.

🌱Sowing
✅ always sow an even amount across the surface of your tray. 
✅ moisten your medium before you sow your seeds. Moisten your seeds after sowing on your medium.
✅ this ensures your seeds are moist and lodged onto the medium for better germination.

348801,"What’s your favorite medium for growing microgreens? 

🌱Growing medium
✅ We use a soilless medium of coco peat, perlite, & a small amount of organic enhancers. 

✅ if your preferred method is growing them hydroponically, we’ve found coco mats with a high compression - 750gsm & up - gives good growth as it helps retain moisture and provides a good hold for the root growth.

✅ check out the the tagged products in the first image.

🌱Growing tips
✅ Give your potting mix a good spray of water before sowing your seeds. This will ensure your potting mix is kept moist during germination.
✅ Spraying water everyday during the germination process might disturb growth and the formation of root structure.
✅Keep your sowed seeds covered in darkness for 2-3 days to allow for germination.

348804,"Bulls Blood Beets microgreens. 
Don’t they look amazing? They taste distinctively like beetroot too!

One of the common issues with growing beetroot microgreens is the seed husks or hulls that stick to the leaves of the greens. 

These hulls are often difficult to remove without damaging the leaves. 

An easy way to ensure the hulls fall off is to cover the seeds with coco coir during germination. The weight of the coconut coir (ensure that the covered layer is watered) is heavy enough to remove the hulls as the first 2 leaves emerge.

Give this method a go! We use the same method of sowing for other seeds like spinach, Fenugreek and borage. Works like a charm!

Me: ""Why salad today ah?""

Wife: ""👀 Looking through the left over foods in the fridge and decided to make salad 🥗 with lettuce, mango, strawberries 🍓 and grilled tempeh. It is healthier to make your own salad dressing than buying off the shelf. 🙂
.
Salad dressing 👉🏼 Equal ratio of Olive Oil/Grapeseed Oil with Apple Vinegar Cider and Agave Syrup/Maple Syrup and shake well. Dash some Sesame Seeds (optional) and shake well..or stir well. Just make sure they are well mixed haha! 😊
.
Grilled tempeh 👉🏼 Equal ratio of Miso and Tahini sauce. Dissolve with hot water. Use the sauce and coat the front and back of tempeh. Grill 🔥 in oven at 180 degrees Celsius for about 25 mins.

Tempeh a good source of protein. 💪🏼😋👍🏻""

-
Combat food waste by 1) eating what’s in season, 2) using what you have in your kitchen, 3) understanding “used by” and “best before” dates and consume before they reach expiration, 4) shopping at local markets or bulk food stores where you can buy only what you need and not more. -

Everything looks so bloody delicious and you might never go back, so why the hell not right? 😳 #foodiepains #cannotzipmypants 😫

☝🏻Pack what you can't finish (portioned nicely of course!) and give to someone who might appreciate a warm meal, or save it for late night munchies. (Bonus for #BYO bags!! 🙌🏻)
✌🏻Ask if shops might have tasting samples (instead of buying full portions that you can't finish) - you might get lucky! 🤟🏻Ask fellow diners if they'd like to try any of the food on your table (BEFORE you go HAM on your food!) - opportunity to make new friends! Travellers have the same problem of  not being able to stomach all the food they wanna try, so there's a good chance your offer will be welcomed. #pickupline #sharingiscaring 😉

Buffets are a great way to try a variety of food, and if you take only what you can finish - it is also great to reduce personal food waste. BUT we get greedy and start taking piles of food we can’t finish and end up throwing platefuls cos “It’s free!!” 😭 “NO!! That’s how we got to this ridiculous rate of consumption and earth’s resources can no longer keep up.” Forests are being cleared to make way for agriculture even those up to 60% of food goes to waste even before it reaches our tables, and there’s what we throw away from our plates…☹️ Pic 2: I really wanted the chocolate spread one morning and they only had the individually-packed ones which I couldn’t finish in one day… So i saved it for the next morning! #plasticwaste #zerowastefail

Food rescues changed my views on expired food and bugs in rice/flour. I've learnt to assess what can or cannot be eaten. These days, #covid19 has shown us how fragile our food supply can be. During crisis, what if food prices gets more expensive or what if countries stop supplying food to us, would you think twice before throwing food away?

371811,"When I was refilling water, my manager asked why buy so huge tumbler? My answer is, no need for me to keep going to the pantry to refill my bottle so much. We need to drink up to 2L of water a day. With this tumbler, I only need to refill it 3 times and not 4 times.

Don't judge me lazy. Cos I have legs difficulties, I find ways to lessen my walking as much as possible.

Another tips is that, with this 850ml size, you can simply fill it with any kind of beverages from drink stalls. Their largest size also can fit this bottle. No need to worry no space for more. And this have the straw function. I'm using the straw to drink so that I can drink water while I still can look at my laptop and work at the same time.

So far, I have been using this for plain water. For coffee, I'm using Swanz Kokoro series bottle.

.
.
I live in an apartment so in order for me to reduce waste I drop off my compost at two diff. types of locations- 1) at a local farmers market for a community garden and 2) at a compost co-op. It was important for me to find as many drop off locations as I could so that I could drop off whereever and whenever I needed to. If you freeze your scraps in your freezer like me, you'd know that at some point you reach criticial mass and really can't stuff anymore in 😂
.
.
Sometimes I fantasize about having a compost heap in my future house, but being able to drop off and forget is sort of nice too. It's definitely less intimidating since you don't have to be responsible for turning it, ensuring its balanced, watering etc
.
.
I love that no matter which location I drop off at, I always run into people just dropping off or coming by. It really shows that the community is eager to engage in diff. methods of waste reduction 🤗

COMPLETELY UNRELATED, I bought dumpling ingredients last weekend because I saw these vegan wrappers and decided to make vegan dumplings for #veganuary 😂

But this week got so busy that I didn't have time to make and eat them

So I froze these babies to #reducefoodwaste and ensure my ingredients didn't go bad. For me, this is such progress as I sometimes have the habit of letting ingredients go bad when I get busy. SO WIN!

372142,"My last few posts have been focused on our low waste efforts during our trip, but I wanted to add some perspective by being honest about how not-so-low waste it was too
.
.
WE FLEW
.
.
There are lots of different stats out there but in short, flying is one of the leading causes of global emissions and topples most individuals' carbon footprint of daily commutes, home energy use, and diets COMBINED. The shorter the commute, the emptier the plane, the worse off it is for the environment as a whole. .
.
I know that many flights offer carbon offsetting, a way to 'offset' the emissions you produce by investing in another environmentally meaninful project or agency, but have not tried this myself. I've read that this is not standardized, complicated to calculate, and potentially immoral. Some see it as paying extra to appease your conscience so it's just enabling bad behaviour
.
.
Thoughts on flights, carbon offsetting, or your experience??

372144,"DAY 4 Seattle low waste travel:  This set up of recycle, garbage, and compost is incredibly common in Seattle!
.
.
Apparently in 2015 Seattle made composting mandatory and any businesses who either didn't do it or did it wrong were fined. .
.
And in 2019, they took it to a whole new level and STARTED COMPOSTING HUMAN REMAINS. Obviously, not from these receptacles but it's now an option along with burial and cremation.

372151,"LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THE JOYS AND (MY) REALITY OF LOW WASTE COOKING
.
.
The reality is that I cook with a lot of imported specialty ingredients that I haven't been able to find in bulk or without packaging. Ingredients like the ones pictured in the 2nd pic such as Thai Basil, dried seaweed, shitake mushrooms, and Thai chilis. Replacing these items with Italian basil or white mushrooms would impact how authentic the dish would turn out. .
.
I often have to cover ~20 miles to get to and from a store that has all necessary ingredients so I usually stock up with as many ingredients as possible to save myself time and gas
.
.
The joy is learning how to perfect my favorite Thai dish of Pad Kra Pow, which is traditionally made with ground pork, as a VEGETARIAN dish (took a pic of the brand of soy-based 'ground' for yall just in case 🤗) and composting ~1 lb of scraps from this one dish alone which turned into 5 meals.
.
.
I like to think that I've managed to cut this dish's carbon footprint by A LOT by switching to non-meat, composting, and turning it into 5 meals total (vs us eating out)😁

At work, we have a daily meeting where we've all become quite addicted to having mandarines at. So I washed my lunch container and started collecting the peels. I'd estimate that 1-2 lbs of this week's drop off consisted of those peels and I like to think I'm normalizing composting as a concept when I collect in front of a group of co-workers 😄

Another new addition to the pile was leeks/green onions I was regrowing. After multiple regrowths the plants lost their flavor and it was time to say goodbye

.
.
How is this low waste you might ask?
.
.
🥫Canned goods are more likely to be recycled (vs single use plastic from frozen) as I didn't have time to prep the fresh ingredients
☕Coffee was organic and placed in a personal container
🥨 Office is doing 12 days of Christmas holiday treats so I bought some peppermint yogurt covered pretzels from the bulk section (also with own container)
🌶 These ingredients are for an office potluck, which I am bringing a vegetarian friendly dish (veggie chili)
🛒 brought my own shopping bag

Maybe one day my 'low waste' grocery haul will be all veggies but you gotta start somewhere!

I spent 40 mins measuring out cardboard to act as dividers. Now that everything is organized LOOK AT HOW MUCH HOT SAUCES I HAVE. I love spicy yall. I literally have no idea where all these plastic utensils came from 😤

It basically came down to a 'single use drawerer that needs to be reused/repurposed as much as possible' and a 'reusable' drawer- rags for wiping down, wax cloth, and oven mitts. The idea is to reduce whats in the single use drawer over time. Wish me luck!

395593,"More reasons to stop the use of microbeads!
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
For one, it may cause sea turtles to produce more female offspring.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Why? More and more micro plastics have been washed up on shore, where sea turtles lay their eggs. However, plastic accumulates heat, and this causes sand temperatures to rise, which has been found to alter the gender of turtle offspring. This is concerning as already in warmer regions, 99% of juvenile sea turtles were found to be female. 
More seriously, it has led to infertility in some marine species and others die from malnutrition from swallowing huge amounts of plastics instead of food.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Are you using micro plastics in your everyday personal care routine?

Lemons have a pH of 2-3; in other words they are extremely acidic substances that can cause erosion to your teeth. If you enjoy drinking lemon water, using a straw can help to reduce the risk of acid exposure to your teeth but remember to use a reusable straw (bamboo or glass preferred over metal) ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
🍋
If you'd like to skip the straw altogether, there are other ways to make sure your teeth are protected from dental erosion. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
🍋
1. NEUTRALIZE with more alkaline foods like plant milk, bananas or apples. 
2. RINSE with water after drinking and wait 30mins before brushing your teeth. 
3. If you prefer to BRUSH BEFORE drinking, wait 10mins for the protective saliva barrier to form before drinking lemon water

Did you know that the fashion industry is the second most polluting industry in the world, second only to oil? It accounts for 10% of global carbon emissions, and is a massive $3 trillion global industry. (Source: Forbes.com) 💰
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
If so much money is in this industry, why are people in it still working for less than minimum wage, suffering abuse and even death from dangerous work environments? Why are companies allowed to continue polluting waterways, poisoning the soil and upsetting eco-systems without recourse? (I am SO mad 😡) ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
In the recent years, fast fashion started to become a staple in our lives. It's designed to be cheap, trendy and diposable; with 50-100 micro seasons in a year, the shopping never ends. Being readily available and marketted on every platform possible, it's easy to get lured into the idea that you can look good at such a low price. But this price you pay does not account for the human and ecological costs of both fabrication of cheap clothing and mass disposal of it. 🛒
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Thankfully clothing brands which are conscious about their environmental impact, and respect their supply chain exist. So let's shift our demand away from disposable fashion to fashion that lasts. (Will showcase conscious brands in future posts and on the blog, stay tuned!) 🌠 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

396553,"Are you eating up the Earth? If so, then watch out for what food you are putting on your plate 

Matter of the fact is most food system activities such as production, transportation, storage and waste are all greenhouse gas emitters and we can do our bit by choosing to buy organic and local when possible (note possible). For example, rather than buying imported oranges which have travelled the seven seas just to get to you, try to buy fruit that is locally or at least regionally grown. A simple act with a huge impact if taken up by many.

Other ways to eat in a more climate smart and environment-friendly way include:
• eat more plant-based food and less meat 
• waste less of the food you eat 
• buy less processed food and eat more raw
• buy seasonal when possible 
• grow your own (not there yet)
• avoid eating endangered fish 
• eat food free of antibiotics or hormones
• purchase in bulk 

It’s only through increased awareness that we can slowly start changing our eating habits and act on Climate a fruit at a time
